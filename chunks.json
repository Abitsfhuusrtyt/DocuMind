tool enhance network quality across various office locations with opmanager's versatile ipsla monitor. get started for free schedule a live demo ipsla monitoring businesses with workplaces spread across multiple global locations share and receive data via a wan link . this demands continuous monitoring of network quality across widespread network locations and paths in order to achieve optimized performance levels and uninterrupted service delivery. ip service level agreement an ip service level agreement, or ip sla, is a network measurement technology that simulates network traffic and ip services by generating continuous, reliable, and predictable data across multiple network locations/paths, and uses the statistics collected from the simulation to analyze the performance of a network in real time. the collected information is time-based, and is used in actively monitoring and troubleshooting a network . to do this, an ip sla source (an ip sla router or a switch) sends data packets across the network, to a destination (any device with an ip). the destination device acknowledges the received data packets, and on the basis of the type of ip sla operation, responds with a timestamp information which is used by the ip sla source to measure various performance metrics . if the destination is an ip sla enabled device, it is called as an ip sla responder, which is capable of providing much more accurate and functional measurements than a non ip sla destination device. cisco ip sla technology and ip sla monitors are widely used by leading network service providers and it admins. cisco ip sla in opmanager opmanager uses cisco ip sla technology to provide uninterrupted, real-time data on the performance of your network by continuously monitoring the traffic in the environment. businesses utilizing ip applications and services are backed up by cisco ip sla monitoring tools to actively monitor ip sla performance and ensure round the clock availability. be it the bandwidth on the key link of your network, the call quality, or the voice over ip (voip) traffic, ip sla monitoring provides clear visibility into your networks and also helps in active troubleshooting. ip sla performance or the performance of a network in general, is based on three parameters: latency or response time: the time it takes for a message to travel from the source to reach the destination is known as latency . higher latency is a result of the poor performance of a network. increasing traffic in the network may cause high network latency. jitter: jitter is the inter packet delay variance between arriving packets. in other words, it is the difference in latency between data packets. this variation occurs when the data packets are queued, or due to configuration errors in the communicating devices. packet loss: the data loss that occurs during the travel of data packets from the source to the destination is referred to as packet loss . the more packet loss, the poorer the connection. data loss may occur due to network congestion, software bugs, or problems with network hardware . round trip time (rtt): as an inclusive measure of the overall latency of a network, it is the entire time (in milliseconds) required by a packet to travel from a specific source to a specific destination, and back again. connectivity: it is a measure of network health between two end points. this metric is calculated by continuously monitoring the link availability between two devices, to check whether the link is reachable. voice quality scores (mos value): mean opinion score (mos) is a standard for measuring the quality of voice across the audio calls on a network. the mos value is dependent on the codec that is used for the transmission of voice packets over ip; and the higher the value, the better is the voice quality. ip sla operations in opmanager opmanager's ip sla monitor supports the following operations. icmp echo operation: for wan rtt monitor icmp path echo operation: used for traceroute or hop by hop monitor udp jitter operation: for voip monitors video operation: for video monitors advantages of using opmanager's ip sla monitor here are a few advantages in leveraging opmanager's ip sla monitor. proactive performance monitoring periodic monitoring of wan links and the supporting devices to ensure uninterrupted connectivity. in-depth quality of service (qos) visibility over call paths within wan range and between corporate users. continuous monitoring of the voip service performance by varying the traffic loads. automated monitoring of network health with end-to-end monitoring of the source and destination devices. reports and scheduling detailed reports on errors, utilization, sla violations, and the performance of the top 10 call paths. historic reports on jitter, latency, mean operation score (mos), and round-trip time (rtt). real-time reports on threshold violation, maximum rtt, and availability . custom report generation on various metrics concerning performance and quality. report scheduling for regular and timely insights into the performance of ip sla devices and their associated metrics. quick troubleshooting continuous monitoring of service levels to forewarn users about all the liable errors and complications with the help of ip service level agreement (ip sla) monitors. quick and easy troubleshooting mechanisms to keep response times in check. voip monitoring voip technology works by converting the analog voice signals into digital signals, and in turn breaking them down into ip packets. these packets are then transferred over the internet, reassembled in the same order, and played as audio signals on the receiver's end. the voip monitor in opmanager helps monitor voice call quality between two remote sites by simulating synthetic traffic to analyze various parameters like latency, mos, rtt, jitter, and packet loss. wan monitoring the wan rtt monitor in opmanager helps monitor the performance of your wan link by simulating organic traffic, which in turn helps you figure out the round trip time (rtt) for that particular path. rtt is the time taken for a data packet to travel from its source to the destination and back. rtt helps in putting together statistical data on the availability and reliability of the entire network. alerts and notifications being able to monitor the performance of ip sla devices is just not enough. you need to have visibility into errors and violations when they occur. with flexible threshold configurations, opmanager's ip sla monitors continuously track service levels and generate instant alerts when violated. establish upper limit thresholds for voip, wan, and video metrics to trigger alarms when their collected values exceed the configured limits. achieve in-depth visibility and control over your entire network. for more information on how opmanager can help effectively monitor

advanced agent-based monitoring feature enhances the monitoring of critical windows devices by installing lightweight agents. these agents provide real-time performance data and interface traffic data significantly reducing the operational load on the opmanager server. by optimizing the polling process, agent-based monitoring ensures efficient, low-overhead device monitoring, allowing it administrators to track device performance without straining network resources. how does opmanager's agent-based monitoring work? unlike traditional polling mechanisms, where the server constantly reaches out to devices, opmanager's agent-based monitoring involves installing a small, lightweight agent on each device. this agent fetches and transmits performance metrics back to opmanager. all communications between the agent and the opmanager server occur over a secure ssl/https connection, ensuring safety and privacy. to ensure the optimum performance of opmanager without carrying out load configuration changes, it is recommended that the agent be installed in not more than 1000 devices. agent monitoring feature in opmanager is available in build 125312 and above . differences from opmanager's agent-less monitoring opmanager supports both agent-based and agentless monitoring , allowing you to enjoy the benefits of both methods. the user interface remains consistent, while performance improvements occur at the backend. this integration ensures that while you gain the advantages of agent-based monitoring, you can still leverage the simplicity and flexibility of agentless monitoring where appropriate. how do i choose between agent-based and agent-less monitoring? each method\u2014agent-based and agentless\u2014has its distinct benefits and is suitable for different use cases: agentless monitoring: simple to set up, non-intrusive, and ideal for small-scale networks where resource overhead is not a major concern. however, it relies heavily on the server's resources, as it polls devices directly. agent-based monitoring: offers more robust performance by reducing server load, optimizing polling, and providing more detailed insights into device performance. it\u2019s ideal for larger networks or environments where efficient use of resources is crucial. opmanager allows a flexible approach, enabling users to choose either method or combine both, depending on specific monitoring requirements. for a detailed comparison between, refer this page on differences between agent-based and agentless monitoring . opmanager agent deployment in lan environment opmanager's agent-based monitoring works seamlessly within local networks (lans), where the opmanager server and agent components perform efficiently: server component: the opmanager server handles the overall monitoring, configuration, and reporting, accessible via a web console. agent component: the lightweight agent installed on each monitored device takes over the polling process, significantly reducing load on the server. all monitor related configuration information are periodically synced to the agent, which the agent then communicates to the opmanager server. web console: a unified portal provides easy access for managing network devices, remotely accessible from any location through a secure vpn or internet connection. notification server: when an agent is installed, it will initiate a secure connection to the notification server to get real-time notifications when a monitor is added/modified, or when actions like test monitor or any inventory update is performed on that device. when a notification is sent to the corresponding device, the agent contacts the opmanager server immediately and collects the updated info about the device's monitors. to learn more, explore how to enable push mode in opmanager agent understand the notification server prerequisites opmanager agent deployment in wan environment for larger networks spread across multiple locations, opmanager enterprise utilizes probe servers to monitor devices in various branches. each branch deploys a probe server that communicates with the central server, allowing real-time monitoring across wide geographical areas with minimal resource consumption. key features of agent-based network performance monitoring: quick setup: installation is easy via manually, or either via active directory or by manually pushing it to devices from opmanager from the agent installation window in the web console. highly optimized polling: high polling frequencies across many devices can drain network resources. agent-based monitoring reduces this network resource usage, enabling efficient real-time monitoring even for large-scale networks. enhanced security: the agent communicates with the server exclusively over ssl, ensuring secure data transmission. with agent-based monitoring, data is sent outward from the agent to the server, minimizing direct communication between opmanager and the device. this approach eliminates security risks associated with direct device monitoring. want to learn more? sign up for a free demo of opmanager to explore how agent-based monitoring can enhance your network performance and security. our experts will guide you through the setup and benefits. frequently asked questions (faqs) what is agent-based monitoring, and how does it work? + agent-based monitoring is a method where small software agents are installed on the devices or systems you wish to monitor. these agents collect performance metrics such as cpu usage, memory utilization, disk space, and network traffic directly from the devices. the agents then send this information back to opmanager at regular intervals. by offloading the data collection process to these agents, opmanager can reduce the load on the central server, thus improving the overall performance of your network monitoring system. this also helps in more efficient and real-time monitoring. how does agent-based monitoring differ from agentless monitoring? + the primary difference lies in how the data is collected and transmitted. agent-based monitoring involves installing software agents on the monitored devices. these agents collect data from the devices and send it to opmanager, reducing the load on the central server. it also allows for more granular monitoring and collection of metrics in real-time. agentless monitoring , on the other hand, does not require any software installation on the monitored devices. instead, opmanager directly polls the devices using standard protocols like snmp, wmi, or ssh to gather data. while agentless monitoring is easier to set up since no software installation is required, it can place a higher load on the monitoring server and may not offer as rich or detailed data compared to agent-based monitoring. is agent-based monitoring available for all devices? + currently, agent-based monitoring is available only for windows-based devices. for other devices, such as linux-based systems, agentless monitoring must be used. however, users can expect future updates or enhancements to expand agent support to more platforms. how do i deploy agents in my network? + agents can be installed manually, via active directory, or remotely through the opmanager web console, with options for automatic updates. the agent installation process is straightforward, and you can configure the agents for automatic updates to ensure they remain up-to-date with the latest features and security patches. related products \u00bb network monitoring

networks and services has become a critical factor of concern for enterprises of all sizes. hence, the implementation of an availability monitoring solution is essential. any downtime of systems, networks, or applications will translate into a huge revenue loss for the business. industry experts say that typical network availability must reach 99.999%. manageengine opmanager provides comprehensive network availability and uptime monitoring to ensure that all your network devices and services are up and running 24*7 continuously. manageengine opmanager which serves as an uptime monitor has an interface that provides real-time views of availability statistics. the dashboard facilitates detailed monitoring and analysis of data from switches, routers, servers, and any other network devices. opmanager provides several availability monitoring, which includes device availability monitoring interface availability monitoring ip sla availability monitoring service availability monitoring windows services availability monitoring website availability monitoring process availability monitoring device availability monitoring device availability monitoring service continuously monitors your entire network for its uptime and network availability. opmanager , as an uptime monitoring tool, polls the device for availability using icmp ping by default. whereas, for non-icmp environment, especially to monitor the availability or uptime for your edge router or dmz zone devices you can use tcp or snmp instead. you can customize the availability polling interval to any specific infrastructure or a particular device, based on your need. opmanager pings the monitored device, i.e; it sends in data packets to the target device and waits for a response. if there is no response after two consecutive pings, then opmanager will consider the device as unavailable. opmanager communicates with the device using monitoring protocols such as icmp, tcp, and snmp. the below image shows the device availability report with their current availability state. opmanager also displays various other device status indications apart from the device up/ down status. this in turn helps you avert false positives. status indications in availability report intented user action & use cases active the device is 'up' and running. down this appears when the device is 'down' or not available. dependent_unavailable appears when the dependent device(s) is down or unavailable. on hold unmanage device: if you wish to pause the device being monitored: at times, you may need to restart the device frequently to fix a problem, so this feature comes in handy to pause opmanager from monitoring the device. on maintenance maintenance state: during the period maintenance window you can place the device under maintenance mode. the maintenance can be scheduled within opmanager . in other words, \"on hold\" is ad-hoc and \"on maintenance\" is scheduled. parent down appears when the parent device is down. dependent down appears when the dependent device is down. here is a chart that explains the downtime severity propagation in opmanager by default. if the device remains unresponsive for the... alarm propagation color code used 1st poll attention state 3 consecutive polls warning state 5 consecutive polls critical state for version 125215 and above, the above said severities can be configured manually via device downtime settings. this helps you in prioritizing your critical servers and other devices in your network. device uplink dependencies: device uplink dependencies can be configured to automatically stop polling a dependent device when the parent device is down. further, it helps you avoid alerts from spamming your inbox with emails and notifications in case of a planned maintenance in your environment. device downtime scheduler: as mentioned earlier, in case of planned maintenance of your network, opmanager allows you to temporarily unmanage a set of devices in your network to avoid numerous alarms being generated because of the same. once a downtime scheduler is active, opmanager will not reach out to that particular set of devices for the period that is specified in the scheduler. you can view the uplink device dependency while configuring the downtime scheduler. interface availability or port availability monitoring manageengine opmanager provides an monitoring agent based or snmp based interface availability and port availability monitoring for each element in the enterprise network and it infrastructure. interfaces polling is enabled by default to continuously monitor the availability of the interface and up/down alerts are generated based on the admin/operation status of that particular interface. opmanager also provides an availability report showing interface availability on a daily, weekly, monthly, or custom period basis to measure your network level availability and ensure that your slas are being met. these interface or port statuses are propagated across multiple facets viz. individual device status, layer 2 network maps, business view or custom device groups, and network weather maps. also, service monitor availability, process availability, and url availability can also be monitored by configuring corresponding protocols. wan links are considered to be the most expensive element for any it infrastructure. opmanager treats these wan links as crucial interfaces and allow you to monitor the availability of the same at all times. personalized reports are also available for the wan links that are discovered in opmanager. ip sla availability monitoring opmanager uses cisco ip sla technology to monitor the availability and performance of ip sla-enabled devices in your network. it provides hop-wise details on latency, bandwidth utilization, round-trip-time, and other performance factors using a powerful network dashboard for enhancing the wan/voip performance. thus manageengine's opmanager enables network admins to perform wan monitoring efficiently. application or service availability monitoring tcp service monitoring: to ensure that your server management plan is complete, monitoring the availability of system-level services is vital. opmanager 's server uptime monitoring feature provides you with detailed graphs and reports about the availability and

opmanager. get started for free schedule a live demo what is not measured cannot be improved. cpu usage is one of the most important performance metrics in server monitoring. it's the primary value to analyze to determine the processing speed of applications, which is a key performance indicator of network and server health. if cpu usage spikes up, the user interface of that server will eventually slow down, and multiple process will crash along with the application running on that server, creating an avalanche effect. high cpu usage can also cause high memory utilization issues that can cause a server to go down for which cpu usage monitoring is important. apart from this, monitoring based on hardware metrics such as cpu temperature monitoring will be an added advantage, as it gives more insights into the cpu's performance. manageengine opmanager: the ideal cpu usage monitoring tool manageengine opmanager monitors servers, virtual machines (vms), routers, switches, firewall, ports, wireless lan controllers (wlcs), storage, and network devices via windows management instrumentation (wmi), simple network management protocol (snmp), and command line interface (cli) protocols periodically. opmanager is a cpu usage monitoring software that enables cpu performance monitoring, cpu health check, cpu resource availability monitoring, cpu speed checks, and more. opmanager is both a linux and windows cpu usage monitor console. network diagnosis threshold-based alerting trend reports cpu usage monitoring: advanced network diagnosis in an enterprise network, a typical office desktop might consume only 30 percent of the cpu usage. however, depending on the application's requirement , about 70 to 100 percent of the cpu is supposed to run cpu-exhausting activities on an average. even then, most servers will run to 90 percent to 98 percent on average, where the cpu is considered to be fully used. if this happens occasionally, say for an adhoc application run or a team video conference call, it is understandable. however, when the cpu utilization spikes over 80 percent too often, the cpu tends to process the requests at a lower speed than desirable and drops requests, leading to a sluggish cpu performance. for network devices if the cpu utilization is high, packet drop is inevitable. this is where cpu load monitoring comes into play. for large and enterprise networks, it is almost impossible to know which server would have high cpu utilization issues, and would require manual actions by technicians or it admins. but these problems can directly hamper business continuity for an uncertain amount of time, which could potentially cost an organization millions of dollars. in a virtual environment, it's not easy to ascertain which device is using high cpu resource without the user informing the it admin. if the cpu spike goes unnoticed, then the server can go down for no apparent reason, causing a disruption in operations. this is why every it needs a cpu load monitor. with a cpu usage monitoring tool like opmanager in place, it's not necessary for the user to keep an eye on cpu usage. opmanager accomplishes this by tracking cpu usage and potential cpu bottlenecks, enabling it admins to improve network performance. cpu usage monitoring: threshold-based alerting opmanager's cpu usage monitor enables it admins to set thresholds for each cpu monitor so they can be informed of the cpu usage limit when the processor time reaches the limit, or when the utilization of the disk exceeds the specified limit. the thresholds can be set according to the number of breaches or severity levels such as attention/ trouble/critical. these alerts can be sent via various notification profiles such as sms, email, slack, etc. cpu usage and cpu utilization monitor: trend reports in opmanager opmanager provides over 100 built-in reports . using the reports feature,, a report can be manually generated or scheduled to be auto-generated in a designated time, based on any parameter for measuring cpu usage. opmanager's reports can be organized to show interfaces or devices with the highest cpu utilization, cpu efficiency, and interface errors for a particular time frame. it is possible to drill down into these metrics to learn more from the reports. reports can be saved as pdf, html or sent via email. cpu usage monitoring: key metrics metrics description monitored cpu utilization monitors the cpu utilization of the network device cpu socket monitors the physical socket number of the cpu chip cpu speed monitors the internal

customizable role-based access control saml authentication disk space monitor learn more about opmanager 's features & functions the availability of disk space in servers is critical. applications running on these servers store log files and write data to the database, which is also installed on the same server; if there's not enough disk space available, then the application can't run properly, and it might crash. monitoring disk space with a potent hardware monitor is essential for it admins to ensure the high performance of servers, and keep network uptime optimum by avoiding a sudden and unforeseen lack of server disk space. challenges with monitoring disk space most organizations use servers from multiple vendors, and each run on different operating system (os) versions. the differences in os versions can make it challenging to collectively monitor the disk space of all the servers at regular intervals. if you're using your own homegrown scripts to monitor them, then you also need to constantly update those scripts to ensure the latest os and metrics are supported. another challenge lies in being notified too late of a disk space issue. only by spotting the issue proactively can you look into the disk space and free some up so the application continues to run. disk data growth is not predictable; for example, logs could be 10mb over one week, then jump to 10gb overnight. in order to either optimize an application so it doesn't consume a huge amount of space or buy additional hard disks and increase the storage, it teams need access to disk space trend reports. these reports need to be generated with historical data to understand the trend and make an informed decision. another challenge it admins face is increased mean time to resolve (mttr). for example, if an application crashes due to a lack of disk space on the server, the organization will experience downtime. and without logs, they have no idea how long it will take to fix the issue, or any idea on how to fix it. it admins also face these challenges on a regular basis: despite it admins monitoring disk space, outages can occur due to a lack of disk data growth trend and threshold-based alerts. lack of notifications when your system is running low on disk space. improper allocation of disk space without considering service-level agreements (slas) and network performance. opmanager : an advanced disk space monitor opmanager is an easy-to-use network and server monitoring solution, and functions as both a linux and windows disk space monitor tool. this disk space monitor software supports monitoring for a wide range of servers including windows, linux, unix, and solaris servers, and uses a wide range of protocols such as simple network management protocol (snmp), windows management instrumentation (wmi), and command line interface (cli) to monitor these servers and critical metrics, such as disk space. opmanager provides over 11,000 device templates to ensure a disk is immediately recognized, and disk monitoring performance monitors are associated with devices. once associated with the devices or a set of devices in bulk, the disk performance monitors can be viewed on the inventory page. additionally, opmanager has many disk space monitor metrics and over 230 dashboard widgets to monitor specific metrics, including top vms by disk i/o usage, disk reads, etc. to present a quick overview of the prevalent disk space status in the network. disk space metrics to monitor in opmanager opmanager has a long list of performance monitors, unlike most disk space monitoring tools. some of them are: disk utilization disk reads disk writes datafile diskreads datafile diskwrites used disk space disk state overall disk load free disk space in gb free disk space in mb used disk space in gb used disk space in mb disk reads per second overall disk volume disk read requests disk write requests disk read latency disk write latency disk space usage disk i/o usage disk space utilization monitoring and forecasting in opmanager forecasting the disk space by usage is an important feature used to predict how long storage will last before it runs out of space. opmanager , a disk space usage monitor, analyzes the current usage rate and growth trend on the device, and approximates how long it will be until the storage runs dry. the advantage is that the algorithm provides three predictions: when the storage will reach 80 percent, 90 percent, and 100 percent of its capacity. workflow automation to check disk space clearing logs is a repetitive, mindless, and painstaking task that has to be performed on a regular basis. very little human intelligence is needed in such a task, so it admins usually write scripts or delete logs manually. but there's a better alternative to this process. repetitive but crucial tasks, like checking for free drive space and clearing logs to make space, can be easily automated using opmanager 's workflow feature. to automatically check for free space in the drive, simply use the check drive free space option available in workflow actions. clearing logs to make space on the disk isn't always feasible, so opmanager provides other workflow actions like compress file, compress folder, get file size, list files, check folder exists, move folder , etc. such workflows can be scheduled to be triggered periodically, or be manually triggered by the it admin. monitor disk space proactively with opmanager 's notification profiles with opmanager , an efficient hard drive monitor as well as disk space monitor, it admins can create performance baselines and receive threshold violation alerts through sms, email, push notifications, or web alarms when a threshold is violated. they can also resolve issues by severity, and set up alarm-escalation rules for it managers to be notified if an issue is not addressed within a specific time frame. such a robust notification mechanism enables proactive disk space monitoring. reports for disk space usage opmanager provides forecast reports for the usage of cpu, memory, and disk for all devices in your network, calculated based on past utilization patterns. storage reports for all devices and their disks are also available in detail. additionally, for all disk space performance metrics, reports can be generated instantly, or scheduled to be generated as preferred in pdf or html formats. related products \u00bb network monitoring \u00bb bandwidth monitoring & traffic analysis \u00bb network

manageengine opmanager opmanager is continuously enhanced and improved to deliver the best monitoring features and network security in the market. as part of this process, legacy versions of opmanager are gradually phased out, starting with an \"end of support\" or eos date announcement. after the specified eos date, users with legacy builds will not be able to renew their annual maintenance support (ams) or avail technical support. users can still continue to use opmanager at their own risk until the version's end of life (eol) date. there will a considerable time gap between the eos dates and the eol dates for a build version. this is done to minimize disruption for the users and give them time to migrate or update to newer versions. however, we strongly recommend timely updates to newer versions if a current build version is listed for end of support. why updating to the latest version of opmanager is recommended we release multiple updates every year to ensure that opmanager remains up-to-date and secure. users who are still using very old versions of opmanager will have to perform multiple updates to upgrade to the latest version. this is a challenging endeavor that we do not recommend. with timely updates, users don't have to face such hassles and can enjoy the following advantages. latest authentication, encryption, and data protection features. critical fixes for bugs and glitches. minimal risk of network security breaches and vulnerabilities. latest monitoring features and functionalities. prevention of data loss and disruptions. support for the

on the important aspects of your computer's hardware. it collects information from different sensors and shows you data about the health, condition, availability, and performance of your computer and the network it's connected to. why is hardware monitor software important? hardware monitors are like health check-ups for your devices. they're used by software programs to measure important information about your device's performance and make sure everything is running smoothly. how to monitor hardware performance? the usual way to check how well your computer or other devices are working is by keeping an eye on things like temperature, fan speed, battery life, and the various parts inside, like the motherboard, cpu, memory, and hard drive. this helps you make sure everything is running smoothly and can prevent any issues. what is the role of hardware monitoring in capacity planning? hardware monitoring tracks historical trends in your devices' cpu, memory, and bandwidth utilization. this allows you to predict when upgrades or expansions will be necessary before performance becomes a problem. what is the role of hardware monitoring in ensuring network security? hardware monitoring can complement network security oversight. unusual spikes in cpu/memory usage, unexpected device reboots, or changes in link status could indicate a security incident (e.g., a denial of service attack, unauthorized access, or malware activity) that affects hardware performance. do you need dedicated components to monitor hardware in your network? most modern network devices are built with snmp agents or apis that allow monitoring software to collect data. you need a dedicated network monitoring system (nms) software running on a server or in the cloud. is data center temperature monitoring part of hardware monitoring? yes, data center temperature monitoring is a critical part of hardware monitoring. while direct hardware monitoring checks a device's internal cpu temperature, climate monitoring assesses the overall environment that directly impacts all hardware (servers, routers, switches). excessive heat drastically reduces hardware lifespan, degrades performance, and causes outages. sensors : dedicated environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, airflow) are placed strategically throughout the data center (in racks, aisles). discovery : network monitoring systems (nms) like solarwinds or opmanager discover these ip-enabled sensors, or appliances containing them (e.g., intelligent pdus), during network scans via icmp and snmp. data collection : the nms then uses snmp to poll specific oids (object identifiers) on the discovered sensors. these oids represent the temperature, humidity, and other readings. nms tools use pre-built templates or allow custom configurations for various sensor types. alerting : collected data is displayed on dashboards and, critically, triggers alerts if readings exceed predefined thresholds, enabling proactive intervention to prevent hardware damage or downtime. how do i monitor hardware usage? you can monitor the hardware utilization by keeping an eye on the resource utilization of your devices. monitoring critical hardware resources such as cpu utilization, memory utilization, disk utilization and network utilization helps you anticipate potential capacity constraints and plan accordingly. discover

templates opmanager recognizes and monitors more than 290 different interface types out-of-the-box. when an interface is discovered using opmanager , it automatically associates a pre-defined template with the necessary monitoring interval and optimal threshold limit for utilization, errors, and discards. a new interface template with pre-defined values can be created and associated with interfaces in bulk or the existing monitoring template can be edited to suit your network monitoring requirement. using opmanager , network admins can set a common monitoring scheme for many interfaces of the same type instead of having to configure for each interface individually. monitoring interfaces using monitoring agents the monitoring agent enables monitoring of interface traffic and triggers alarms when predefined thresholds are exceeded.the monitoring agent provides traffic data for interfaces on windows servers. the monitoring agent gathers all the information without using the snmp protocol and it identifies both local and virtual adapters using the windows api and fetches essential metrics such as inoctets, outoctets, indiscards, and more, transmitting them to opmanager for analysis. monitoring switch interfaces opmanager , the comprehensive network interface monitoring tool, supports network switch monitoring in a hierarchical inter-networking environment. the core switch is the high-capacity physical backbone of a network. it handles routing, forwarding, and also serves as the point of contact for a wide area network (wan) or the internet. the distribution switch links the core switch with the access switches. it acts as a subgroup for the core switches and is used for setting up distribution points in a large organization. access switches connect the majority of devices to the network with high-density ports. using opmanager , you can discover all the switches in a network by discovering the core switch. opmanager automatically discovers and classifies the rest of the interfaces mapped to the core switch. you can also configure uplink dependency to prevent unnecessary alarms when the core or distributed switch goes down. it associates the related interface template configured automatically and places them on a switch map. the switch ports are also discovered and intuitively placed on a business view (maps) which helps you graphically visualize your entire switch network. interface monitoring metrics opmanager monitors various interface metrics like link speed, hop count, or time delay etc. router metrics are used to make routing decisions by a router and is a part of the routing table. a router metric is typically based on information such as path length, bandwidth, load, hop count, path cost etc. manual update of description for each and every interface in a network is a time-consuming process. opmanager simplifies interface monitoring by automatically updating the description of metrics. interface monitoring alarms opmanager simplifies the process of interface management by implementing advanced alert monitoring capabilities. opmanager helps you identify the root cause of interface problems and provides color-coded alarms which are presented in a user-friendly format. network administrators can view the event history associated with an alarm and manually clear or delete the alarms. opmanager also provides business views which helps you group the interfaces together and view it on a map to provide a graphical representation of devices according to the business service they cater to. this helps you ensure the availability of business-critical interfaces at all times and helps in quick troubleshooting. interface monitoring graphs and reports opmanager provides detailed interface graphs for discard rate, interface utilization, packets, interface traffic, errors and discards, error rate, etc. in the interface snapshot page of individual interfaces. these graphs are useful in monitoring the performance of interfaces over a period of time. the graphs can also be generated as a report which can be used for auditing or presentation purposes. opmanager , by default, provides over 200 in-built reporting profiles to simplify network interface management. prev next monitor interfaces in your network today! download opmanager , the efficient and affordable network interface monitoring tool. faq -

opmanager. get started for free schedule a live demo monitoring memory usage is essential in ensuring maximum performance. high rates of memory utilization result in decreased performance for the associated processes. in addition, a steady increase in memory utilization over time may indicate a memory leak. a memory leak is when processes allocate memory as they start, but is not released when they end. memory leaks degrade device performance over time. typically, the device becomes unresponsive when memory is no longer available. memory monitoring software helps keep track of the free memory available. memory use is tracked so that unexpected changes in usage can be detected, analyzed, and corrected. memory monitoring tool monitors proactive memory usage with the help of highly customizable reports to provide in-depth insights into your memory usage. accessing this information helps ensure memory utilization issues won't hinder your application availability or performance, and provides a more satisfactory end-user experience. memory utilization is the average utilization derived from the percent of available memory in use at a given moment. manageengine opmanager: the ideal memory utilization monitor opmanager's windows memory monitoring process monitors the memory utilization on windows and unix-based servers using snmp, wmi, or cli protocols. opmanager's memory performance monitor allows you to set memory thresholds so that you get alerted if your machine\u2019s memory utilization reaches a critical level predetermined by you. opmanager effectively ensures that: memory leaks are detected using cpu memory monitoring before performance is affected. the minimum amount of physical memory required by the system remains available. the total amount of physical memory allotted to the server is not exceeded. opmanager monitors all the following metrics: free physical memory memory utilization page faults page reads page writes pages per second available page-file memory size available physical memory available virtual memory opmanager's memory monitoring helps you: instantly monitor memory threshold-based alerting manage resources analyze memory

spiceworks alternative network access control customizable role-based access control saml authentication network activity monitor monitor network activity with manageengine opmanager opmanager is a network activity monitoring tool that enables it admins to track even the smallest activity on their networks in real-time. this way, it admins can minimize downtime and the mean time to resolve (mttr). on a granular level, there is a vast amount of activity happening on each network device in the it infrastructure of an organization, like packet transmission, messages from network protocols, device status events, etc. network activity becomes a bread crumb used to identify network bottlenecks when an issue is detected, so even the most minute network activity should be monitored as it directly impacts overall network performance, health, and uptime. network activity is monitored with the help of a network monitoring tool like opmanager . for a better understanding of how and which network activities can be observed, monitored, and analyzed, they can be classfied into two types: device level and user level. device level: each and every device, port, interface, firewall, and application in a network needs to be monitored for activity to keep the network in check and improve uptime. this can be accomplished by: monitoring all network device activity via simple network management protocol (snmp), windows management instrumentation (wmi), and command-line interface (cli) protocols proactively. monitoring traps, event logs, and syslogs. viewing a device summary and interface status. monitoring virtual private network (vpn) activity. monitoring bandwidth to check incoming and outgoing traffic. network configuration change tracking. user level: the network activity of every it employee and their device, along with their vpn connections, internet usage trends, etc. need to be monitored by optimized network activity monitoring software that uses user activity monitoring (uam). network activity monitoring with opmanager using snmp, wmi, and cli protocols snmp monitoring: using an snmp credential, opmanager sends an snmp request to the snmp agent running on the device being monitored, and receives a response. this response contains data about network activity. wmi monitoring: using the wmi protocol, opmanager , windows network activity monitoring software, can monitor windows server performance, microsoft hyper-v devices, windows services, event logs, exchange servers, files, folders, active directories, log files, and sql servers. cli monitoring: opmanager uses the cli protocol, linux network activity monitor software, for linux device activity monitoring. for non-snmp devices, the cli commands fetch network activity data for opmanager . monitoring network activity with snmp traps and syslogs via snmp, devices being managed with opmanager provide network activity data using the mib and oid files that describe device status. snmp traps are encrypted alerting messages containing information on system status and configuration in network devices with ips. opmanager can process up to 300 snmp traps per second. information from traps raised is helpful to solve latency and packet loss issues. opmanager follows a rule-based methodology of fetching syslogs via the user datagram protocol (udp), reading the syslogs, and associating them with notification profiles to notify it admins. alarm messages and alarm severity can be set up for intelligent alerting. monitoring event ids on windows servers the windows event log is a service that stores program, security, system, and application logs occurring in windows devices. opmanager collects event logs from monitored devices using the wmi protocol, and provides 50 eventlog monitors right out of the box. opmanager enables it admins set up event log rules using event ids, which are unique identifiers for particular events. this way, device status and activity can be tracked by opmanager using event logs. device summary and interface status monitoring the device inventory is made up of all devices discovered by opmanager . on the device summary page, you can find graphs detailing tx traffic, rx traffic, and uptime. ping device and trace route are also available to track network activity. network activity monitor reports with opmanager , the history of device performance monitoring and downtime statistics can be viewed as real-time or scheduled reports in html, jpg, or pdf formats. with these reports, it's easy to analyze network activity and understand network device and bandwidth requirements. with over 100 built-in reporting profiles that can be automatically and periodically sent to mailboxes at the admin's preferred interval, network activity monitoring becomes all the more simple. for more detailed insight on network activity, reports can be generated for a single device in the network, the business views of distributed networks of the organization, or device and interface groups. monitoring vpn activity in opmanager with opmanager 's vpn monitoring feature, it admins can monitor all their vpn connections from a single console. additionally, they can monitor the status of vpn tunnels, track the number of active client connections, measure vpn bandwidth utilization, and keep tabs on vpn activity trends. bandwidth usage trend activity tracking netflow analyzer , available as an add-on in opmanager , performs network traffic analysis on flow data and monitors all network activity, such as incoming and outgoing traffic. it monitors and analyzes bandwidth usage trends and traffic patterns; provides traffic information by source, destination, and conversations to help admins understand what exactly is happening in the network; and helps admins decide whether the traffic hitting the network is legitimate or a cyberattack, such as a distributed denial of service (ddos) attack. network configuration change tracking network admins make frequent network device configuration changes to serve different business needs, and need to maintain a record of all the configuration changes made, when they were made, and who made them. maintaining a history of configuration changes will help identify the root cause of an issue whenever one pops up. network configuration manager , an add-on within opmanager , helps in tracking change in network activities with configuration backups, compliance management, configuration task automation and execution, configuration reports, and firmware vulnerability management. user activity monitoring (uam) firewall analyzer monitors user activity in a network by analyzing user activity logs from the firewall. firewall analyzer also provides detailed reports on vpn usage trends, internet bandwidth usage, failed logon attempts, and cloud application usage activity by employees in the organization. firewall analyzer is available as an add-on in opmanager . notification profiles for instant alerts on network faults opmanager 's report scheduler lets admins compare devices based on any parameter, and export a copy as a shareable document. moreover, by setting up custom snmp mib variables, opmanager enables performance monitoring to be truly vendor independent. opmanager sends alerts via email or sms ; by running a system command or program ; by logging a ticket; by raising a web alarm , syslog , or trap ; by sending slack notifications; and more. but so many alerts and notifications can sometimes be unnecessary, which is why opmanager classifies them by severity to help it admins know when and on which alarm they need to take action, priority-wise. attention: low severity trouble: medium severity critical: high severity service down: non-responsive device rearm: to reset the alerting condition after it has been triggered network activity overview: opmanager dashboard opmanager offers a highly custom, role-based dashboard that tracks the parameters it admins deem necessary. admins can drag and drop widgets to get a birds-eye view of all network activity; if anything suspicious is detected, they can drill down to identify the source. using opmanager , admins can gain visibility into each device's health, uptime, and availability graphs and reports, all on an easy-to-understand dashboard. related products

monitoring organizations today face increasing competition and growing complexity in operating their business. given this scenario, having a network infrastructure that performs at maximum efficiency is no longer a luxury. rather, it is a necessity for any organization that wishes to emerge as a front runner in their respective domain. optimum performance of every network device in a network infrastructure has become an unwritten mandate that organizations have to abide by to achieve business success. a single minute of downtime can cause thousands, and millions of dollars worth of losses. to ensure network performance consistency and achieve optimal efficiency, network device monitoring is essential. proactive monitoring of network devices ensures maximum roi for an organization's it budget. proactive network device monitor proactively monitoring your network device is a cyclic process that includes the following steps: identify critical kpis: every network device will have a set of critical kpis whose monitoring is essential to ensure its optimum functioning. using a reliable network device monitoring tool to identify the vital devices in your network infrastructure and their corresponding kpis is the first step to proactive network device monitoring . setup proactive monitoring systems to monitor key performance indicators (kpis): create a list of critical kpis for each device and vendor, and set up your network device monitoring tool to proactively monitor the kpis for each device. this process also involves setting up clearly defined thresholds for each of the kpis. gain in-depth visibility into kpi performance: after the monitors have been configured, you must track the kpis continuously. to monitor network devices effectively, you can also compare the performance of the kpi among multiple related devices to gain better insights into the overall performance of your network infrastructure. get proactive alerts into your network device performance: the aim of network devices monitoring is not to get alerted when a problem occurs, but to get alerted so that a problem does not occur. it is important to set up proactive alerts using network device monitoring services, to be notified in advance so that your organization's network infrastructure can ensure strict compliance to slas, and avoid downtime. periodically analyze performance and implement changes: network devices monitoring is not a process, it's a cycle. you have to periodically perform in-depth analysis of monitored data to identify trends in network faults, identify potential faults that impact network device performance, devise fault management solutions to fix those problems, and implement those changes in your network. this way the network monitor ensures your network device efficiency improves over time. opmanager : a simple, robust network device monitoring tool manageengine opmanager is a network device monitoring software that has

packet loss monitoring build seamless end user experience by keeping the packet loss in check with opmanager get started for free schedule a live demo network packet loss monitoring is an integral part of network monitoring. the key steps to understanding and fixing packet loss are measuring its existence accurately, pinpointing exactly what is causing the latency, and maintaining a healthy network. these tasks are accomplished with opmanager , the comprehensive network performance monitoring tool that ensures all your network devices are up and running 24/7. causes of network packet loss packet loss can be caused by any or a combination of the following: 6 major causes network congestion: when network traffic hits maximum capacity, packets have to wait to be delivered. packets are the first thing to be left behind when a network is trying to catch up with traffic and the connection can only handle so much data. problems with network hardware: hardware that is old, or otherwise outdated, can significantly weaken your network. firewalls, routers, and network switches all take up a considerable amount of power. if your company grows but your hardware capabilities don\u2019t expand with it, you could experience increased packet loss or even total connectivity loss. software bugs: unchecked bugs in your network devices can disrupt network performance, and prevent it from sufficiently carrying packets leading to packet loss issues. overloaded devices: overloaded devices on your network means devices are running at a higher capacity than they were designed to handle. sometimes packets on overutilized devices make it to their destinations, but by then the network is too weak to process the packets and send them back out. many devices have buffers in place to put packets in holding patterns until they can be sent out. however, these buffers can get filled up quickly, and excess packets are still dropped which causes packet loss. security threats: we also cannot ignore the possibility of someone deliberately tampering with your network to cause packet loss. packet drop attacks have become popular with cybercriminals in recent years. essentially, a hacker gets into your router and tells it to drop packets. if you notice a sudden drop in packet success or a significant slowdown in network speed, you could be in the midst of an attack. faulty configuration changes: a faulty configuration change to the device can also cause packet loss. this can be avoided by conducting performance tests before rolling out any changes on the network. also, once the change is pushed, it is best to verify all critical performance metrics. opmanager: an effective network packet loss monitoring tool manageengine opmanager uses internet control message protocol (icmp) pings to measure network packet loss . this involves sending one ping per second between hosts and counting how many times the request is lost. with accurate measurements of packet loss, both real-time and historical, opmanager helps end-users ensure their networks are performing up to expectations. how to fix packet loss with opmanager? detecting, troubleshooting, and preventing packet loss is the key to optimal network performance. the best way to reduce packet loss is by monitoring packet loss. if packet loss is a symptom of a larger issue, monitoring across your network can recognize problems and immediately alert you. a network packet loss test tool like opmanager can make it much easier to discover what is causing your network to drop packets and will provide you with more visibility, which helps mitigate the effects of packet loss and increase network performance. with opmanager you can perform: availability monitoring errors and discards monitoring monitoring configuration changes threshold based alerting packet loss monitoring on wan availability monitoring opmanager pings all monitored devices at defined monitoring intervals, and if any device has a huge packet loss, opmanager notifies you immediately by sending an email or text message and keeps the network availability in check. errors and discards monitoring all network devices discard packets depending on their memory, which can affect performance. these problems are common with routers and switches. since discarding packets increases application latency, excessive discards could indicate that there's a problem with the switch, or the device interacting with the switch. insufficient bandwidth allocation is also a concern for packet drops. network errors are diverse; they could be caused by a dns issue, tcp timeout, or a lack of response from the server. a switch or a router can misinterpret a packet due to a protocol mismatch when updating device configurations. opmanager helps you monitor and reduce packet loss due to errors and discards . monitoring configuration changes opmanager manages all the configuration changes on your network devices using its manageengine network configurations manager add-on. with these capabilities, opmanager helps you to: schedule configuration backups, and restore trusted configuration versions in a single click detect changes in real-time, and knows the \"who\", \"what\", and \"when\" of configuration changes stop unauthorized configuration changes using approval workflows ensure complete security and compliance for every configuration change threshold-based smart alerts in opmanager , separate alerts specifically for packet loss tell you when there are instances of packet loss in your system, and what device is responsible for it. these threshold based alerts enable you to: specify thresholds, and get notified when packet loss hits the limit so you can take the appropriate steps to avoid them. configure an increasing or decreasing threshold for packet loss add more intelligence to threshold configurations by specifying the number of violations allowed before actually triggering an alert. you can implement bulk threshold configurations, tool avoid false alerts by specifying a rearm value to clear alerts packet loss monitoring on wan wide area networks (wans) are prone to network congestion during periods of heavy utilization. when different traffic is vying for limited shared resources, packets inevitably will be dropped or delivered out of order, causing packet loss. the process of tracking important metrics using a packet loss monitoring software to avoid packet loss in wan communication is called network packet loss monitoring. you can use opmanager 's wan monitoring feature as a network packet loss monitor to monitor packet loss. opmanager 's wan monitoring feature enables enterprises to get all the benefits of a shared wan, including cost-effective bandwidth, without sacrificing performance. locate wan packet loss issues with precision: monitor network packet loss using opmanger's wan monitor. it identifies outages between two network stations by performing a traceroute action to get the required information on packet loss. this network packet loss monitor helps you drill down and precisely locate the hop at which the outage occurred. configure and resolve threshold violation issues: you can use the wan monitoring feature in opmanager to configure threshold values for packet loss. you can also generate visual reports using opmanager to obtain information about threshold violations so you can make informed decisions to avoid network packet loss. faqs - packet loss monitor what are network packets? + packets, or network packets, are small units of data carried over a network. as their name suggests, these are small, discrete units of data. alone, these units don\u2019t necessarily make much sense. they\u2019re just portions of the overall message being transmitted, which have been assembled into multiple layers. however, when combined, these packets achieve meaning. packets have to move through a range of hubs to reach their destination. what is packet loss? + the goal of a network packet is to send information reliably. each packet sent includes information such as the source and

has more than 100 prebuilt reports that provide critical insights into your network performance, supports over 53,000 multi-vendor devices, and offers more than 10,000 device templates for effortless monitoring. device availability testing: ensure all the physical/virtual connections are spot on ping: a ping (packet internet groper) works on internet control message protocol (icmp) by transmitting packets. opmanager sends an icmp echo message to the target device. when the target device sends an icmp echo response, the device is active and responding. you can test the availability of all your servers, switches, routers, firewalls, and networking devices using opmanager . snmp ping: with opmanager , you can test if snmp is enabled in the networking device by retrieving management information base (mib) values. it also collects information from the target device such as dns name, system name, location, system type, and system description. proxy ping: a proxy works on a higher layer of the tcp/ip network model, where there is no direct access to the ip. proxy ping is used to ping a target device using a cisco router. the router acts as the proxy for the target device and responds to the ping request, and the status of the destination device is acquired. network service and process testing tool after testing the servers for availability, it is essential to test the availability of services and processes in the servers. service and process testing identify possible roadblocks for end users accessing applications on the server and for sharing resources in your network. this is a more balanced server testing plan. opmanager tests the availability of services such as dns, imap, pop, ftp, https, and windows services along with the processes running in any number of servers in your it infrastructure. opmanager also offers windows network testing tools such as wmi query tool that helps execute custom wmi queries. url testing with opmanager 's network testing tools even with all its servers, services, and processes running coherently, a website can fail to work for the end user. it is imperative to test the urls that bring in valuable traffic. with opmanager , you can test the urls for availability. opmanager also searches for key text on the web page and alerts you if the specified text is not found. this way, you can easily detect attacks on your website. traceroute - detect network attacks with a traceroute tool , you can identify a malicious attacker who might be redirecting your traffic by manipulating routing standards. this can be tested with the help of hop counts. when the hop count exceeds the usual value, there is a possibility of a potential network attack. once you have tested the network for attacks and performance, the next step is network optimization. workflows - powerful automations from opmanager automate routine and laborious network testing with opmanager 's workflows . workflows let the users define conditions, variables, and actions for performing tasks. you can create a workflow to test the availability of devices and schedule the workflow for any or all of the devices in your network. based on the ping result, you can execute multiple actions automatically. the commands include: restarting servers, and starting, stopping and resuming services escalating device failure messages logging trouble tickets pushing configurations to devices notifying through sms, email, slack channels, and more apart from these tests on gauging the network's state using various network testing tools, it admins need complete visibility into network operations. real-time alerts becum crucial since there's nothing worse than learning that the network is down from an end user. therefore monitoring your network performance and receiving alerts before outages occur is a more balanced it infrastructure management plan. this is possible only with the help of network performance test tools. however, it is better and easier to manage if all the tools are consolidated into a single network performance testing software. once the network performance is gauged, troubleshooting network issues (if any) will be the next part. opmanager also makes network troubleshooting easy. network performance testing tools: opmanager 's network performance testing tool set includes: cpu monitor memory monitor

routers direct traffic across internal and external networks, making them critical to both performance and security. monitoring ensures that routing paths are optimal and devices aren\u2019t misconfigured or overloaded\u2014preventing performance bottlenecks and downtime. they act as the first line of defense against network threats compromised routers are a common vector for cyberattacks (e.g., ddos amplification, rogue firmware). proactive router monitoring can detect anomalous behavior like unusual port activity or bandwidth spikes\u2014helping security teams act before threats escalate. wan congestion has direct and adverse impact on user experience enterprise users often share frustration when productivity tools like microsoft 365 or voip services slow down. in many cases, unmonitored routers with poor qos settings or saturated links are to blame. monitoring helps detect when link saturation or incorrect routing causes delays. router monitoring enables smarter capacity planning as business traffic grows (especially video, collaboration apps, and cloud access), it must know when routers or wan links are nearing capacity. historical trend data from router monitoring tools allows for informed decisions about scaling or redesigning the network. downtime and sla violations are costly router issues that go unnoticed can cause prolonged outages, violating slas and affecting mission-critical operations. monitoring router availability, error rates, and interface health reduces mean time to detect (mttd) and mean time to repair (mttr). router firmware and configuration auditing is often overlooked unnoticed outdated firmware or misconfigurations on routers lead to major vulnerabilities. router monitoring tools that integrate with configuration management help maintain compliance and prevent downtime from incorrect changes. hybrid and remote work increases router stress with more users accessing networks remotely or via vpns, edge routers are under increased strain. monitoring ensures these endpoints don\u2019t become chokepoints or security gaps in a hybrid work setup. managing the fine balance between over/under subscription wan links and the routers that serve them are usually the most expensive part of the network, and managing bandwidth allocation can be complex. over-subscribing to bandwidth could mean that the company is paying for more bandwidth than required and under-subscribing could result in congestion and unacceptable network performance. wan monitoring and router monitoring thus become critical to not just day-to-day productivity but also to a company's bottom-line. network managers will need to optimize the quality of service by balancing throughput, committed information rate (cir) and burst rate with congestion, response time, and discards. challenges of managing wan links through router monitoring managing and monitoring routers within enterprise wans is increasingly complex, especially as organizations adopt hybrid cloud models, remote work, and multi-isp strategies.this complexity introduces significant challenges that can impact network performance, security, and operational efficiency. dual-wan deployment in a distributed enterprise consider a multinational company with branch offices across various regions.to ensure continuous connectivity, each branch employs a dual-wan setup, combining mpls and broadband connections.the goal is to achieve load balancing and automatic failover. however, in the absence of effective router and wan monitoring: failover mechanisms may not trigger promptly during outages. load balancing might not distribute traffic optimally, leading to congestion. performance issues can go undetected until they affect end-users. key challenges in router and wan monitoring bandwidth allocation optimization : misjudging bandwidth needs can lead to either over-provisioning (wasting cost) or under-provisioning (causing congestion). monitoring tools must help balance utilization with actual demand per link. high network availability and redundancy: wan links are often a single point of failure in branch connectivity. monitoring must ensure uptime through redundancy checks, failover testing, and sla compliance. rapid resolution of wan issues: latency spikes, packet loss, or link failures can severely impact real-time services. admins need real-time alerts, diagnostic tools (like traceroute/hop analysis), and historical data to resolve wan issues quickly. capacity planning for future needs: as usage grows due to cloud adoption, video conferencing, or remote work, it\u2019s critical to identify trends and forecast when upgrades will be needed. cost management of recurring link expenses: mpls and leased lines are expensive. monitoring can reveal underutilized links, helping justify cost optimization or transitions to sd-wan/internet-based links. identifying high traffic sources and patterns: visibility into top talkers (users or apps), traffic spikes, and protocol types is essential. integrations with flow analysis tools like netflow/sflow provide detailed usage insights. spotting and replacing problematic legacy routers: older routers with limited memory, cpu, or outdated firmware often fail under modern traffic loads. monitoring must track device performance (cpu, memory, crc errors, discards) and flag anomalies early. limited visibility across hybrid environments: traditional nms tools struggle with end-to-end visibility in hybrid wans that span mpls, cloud, and broadband connections. advanced monitoring must bridge this gap. multi-vendor configuration management: maintaining consistent router configurations across different vendors and models increases the risk of misconfigurations. monitoring should integrate with config tools to push changes and validate setups. inconsistent sla metrics from isps: each service provider defines performance metrics differently. a monitoring solution must normalize this data to allow fair comparisons and sla verifications. security across public and private links: with more wan traffic moving over public internet (via sd-wan), encryption, anomaly detection, and firewall monitoring must be part of router/wan monitoring strategies. troubleshooting complexity: diagnosing whether a slow application is due to routing issues, isp problems, or local lan conditions requires correlated data across layers\u2014routing tables, link stats, and app performance. vendor and isp coordination: multiple circuits across geographies mean more slas, contracts, and escalations. monitoring tools that track per-link history and outages help streamline provider accountability. here's a quick checklist to ensure these challenges are accounted for to overcome these challenges, organizations should: implement comprehensive monitoring tools: utilize solutions that offer end-to-end visibility across the network, including application performance and security metrics. enhance security measures: integrate advanced security features into the sd-wan infrastructure to protect against threats and improve monitoring capabilities. optimize underlay provisioning: carefully plan and provision the underlying network to support the demands of the sd-wan overlay. ensure robust cloud connectivity: employ monitoring tools that provide detailed insights into cloud traffic to maintain optimal performance. by proactively addressing these areas, organizations can enhance their router and wan monitoring strategies, leading to improved network performance, security, and user satisfaction router and wan monitoring with opmanager proven benefits of router monitoring - powered by opmanager maximize link efficiency :

as sdp, jira etc. opmanager is designed to work seamlessly across a wide range of networking environments, offering extensive compatibility with industry-leading router vendors and communication protocols. whether you're managing a small branch network or a globally distributed infrastructure, opmanager ensures robust and continuous monitoring of your router ecosystem. supported routers opmanager supports monitoring of routers from virtually any vendor that complies with standard network management protocols. if your router supports snmp, wmi, or cli-based access, opmanager can monitor it- no matter the brand. popular router vendors supported include: cisco juniper hp huawei mikrotik d-link fortinet arista palo alto (when used as routing devices) any snmp-enabled router whether it\u2019s a core router in your data center or a branch-level edge router, opmanager can automatically discover, classify, and monitor it\u2014providing real-time insights into its performance and availability. protocols used for router monitoring opmanager leverages a combination of powerful network management protocols to ensure comprehensive router monitoring: snmp (simple network management protocol): the backbone of device monitoring in opmanager. snmp (v1, v2c, v3) is used to collect vital metrics like cpu usage, interface throughput, memory utilization, packet loss, and more from routers. icmp (internet control message protocol): used for basic availability and latency checks. icmp pings help determine whether the router is reachable and how quickly it responds, aiding in real-time fault detection. cli (telnet/ssh): for deeper diagnostics and configuration-level checks, opmanager supports cli-based access using telnet or ssh. this is especially useful when integrated with manageengine network configuration manager to push changes or collect config backups from routers. wmi (windoes management instrumentation) : applied for windows-based routers or interfaces to gather performance statistics where snmp is not used. flow technologies (via integration with netflow analyzer): protocols like netflow, sflow, jflow, and ipfix provide deep traffic-level visibility when routers are exporting flow data. this allows administrators to monitor top talkers, bandwidth hogs, and application-specific usage across wan links. key router monitoring metrics in opmanager performance metrics cpu utilization \u2013 detect processing strain during peak loads or routing table updates. memory utilization \u2013 monitor memory leaks or usage spikes that may impact stability. interface bandwidth utilization \u2013 analyze actual usage vs. capacity on individual interfaces. errors and discards \u2013 identify packet drops due to crc errors, input/output issues, or buffer overruns. health & environmental metrics temperature and voltage \u2013 detect overheating or unstable power conditions. buffer statistics \u2013 check buffer hits, misses, and failures to detect congestion. crc errors & collisions \u2013 pinpoint faulty cables or signal integrity issues. interface status (up/down) \u2013 alert if any wan or lan interface flaps or goes down. traffic (in/out) \u2013 track inbound/outbound traffic trends per interface. these metrics are retrieved primarily via snmp and cli (telnet/ssh) and can be displayed in real-time dashboards, historical trend charts, and threshold-based alert systems. setting up router monitoring with opmanager opmanager makes it easy to discover, classify, and monitor routers using an agentless setup. here\u2019s a step-by-step summary of the implementation process: 1. discover devices : use the discovery wizard to scan your ip range or import devices using a csv. opmanager auto-identifies devices (routers, switches, etc.) via snmp and classifies them. 2. enable snmp access on routers : ensure snmp (v1/v2c/v3) is enabled and configured on your routers. provide snmp credentials in opmanager under settings > discovery > credentials. 3. apply monitoring templates : apply router-specific performance templates which include predefined monitors for cpu, memory, traffic, etc. you can also create custom snmp monitors for vendor-specific oids. 4. set thresholds and alerts : configure threshold-based alerts (e.g., cpu > 80%, packet errors > 5%) for each performance metric. assign notification profiles to receive alerts via email, sms, slack, or integrated ticketing tools. 5. visualize performance : use dashboards, business views, and heat maps to visualize router health and link status. set up real-time dashboards or noc views for continuous monitoring. 6. generate reports : use built-in reports like availability reports, interface utilization, top n routers by traffic, and more. schedule automatic report generation for audits and sla tracking. 7. automate response and integration : use workflows to automate responses (e.g., restart an interface) upon certain alerts. integrate with tools like network configuration manager to push updates or backup configurations. to learn more about router monitoring and how it can help

experience? + routers have a direct influence on these critical pillars for any business in terms of performance: routers have a role to play in reducing latency, jitter, and packet loss (application performance). it is efficient at finding optimal paths, enforcing qos, and securing traffic (cloud access). routers act as a control tower, managing congestion, dns resolution, and roaming continuity (user experience). integrating tools like netflow analyzer with opmanager allows deep traffic insights, helping balance network loads and prevent bandwidth underutilization or saturation. how does opmanager help detect and resolve routing loops? + routing loop happens when data packets circulate endlessly between two or more routers because of inconsistent or incorrect routing table entries. this stops the packets from reaching the destination - instead they get forwarded, consuming bandwidth and in turn causing delays or outages. opmanager helps tackle routing loops by continuously monitoring key router metrics. it detects abnormal traffic patterns- like repeated hops, ttl expirations, or interface congestion- that indicate looping behavior. with real-time alerts and historical data, network admins can quickly identify misconfigured routers or protocol mismatches causing the loop. by visualizing network paths and interface health, opmanager aids in tracing and resolving the loop's origin, ensuring traffic reaches its destination without unnecessary detours or degradation. how do custom snmp monitors in opmanager help with vendor-specific router metrics? + router vendors like cisco, juniper, and fortinet each define unique snmp oids and mib structures for performance metrics, leading to inconsistencies in monitoring. for example, cpu utilization or memory usage might be structured differently across vendors, making uniform visibility a challenge. in practice, this forces it admins to juggle a maze of vendor-specific monitoring tools, mib browsers, and snmp queries- just to get basic health insights. opmanager\u2019s custom snmp monitors cut through this complexity by allowing admins to map any vendor-specific oids directly, ensuring consistent, centralized monitoring across even the most diverse router fleets. how can adaptive thresholds in opmanager enhance router monitoring? + adaptive thresholds enables baselining; adjusting the thresholds proactively based on historical trends. this reduces false alerts and highlights potential anomalies. if a router's cpu usage typically spikes during backups at midnight, opmanager understands it and doesn't flag it as an issue, unless it exceeds the normal peak range - thereby reducing alert fatigue. if bandwidth usage on a branch router suddenly drops below normal weekday levels. opmanager can trigger an alert for potential link failure. by learning normal patterns over time, adaptive thresholds make router monitoring smarter, more accurate, and aligned with real-world usage. how to monitor router performance? + to monitor router performance effectively, focus on metrics such as: cpu and memory utilization: high usage can signal hardware bottlenecks. interface throughput: analyze data rates to ensure the router is handling traffic as expected. errors and discards: monitor for crc errors, packet drops, and input/output discards. buffer utilization: high buffer misses could indicate traffic congestion. advanced tools like opmanager provide features such as real-time snmp-based monitoring, detailed performance graphs, and customizable alerts to diagnose issues like overloaded processors or misconfigured interfaces. how to optimize wan bandwidth? + wan bandwidth optimization requires: traffic pattern analysis: use tools to identify high-bandwidth applications and users. qos policies: implement quality of service to prioritize critical traffic. threshold-based alerts: set thresholds for bandwidth usage to prevent over-subscription. router upgrades: ensure devices support higher bandwidth and modern routing protocols like mpls or sd-wan. integrating tools like netflow analyzer with opmanager allows deep traffic insights, helping balance network loads and prevent bandwidth underutilization or saturation. what are the key aspects of router monitoring? + key aspects of effective router monitoring and management include: traffic monitoring: analyze interface-level traffic patterns to detect congestion. error and discard analysis: monitor for errors like packet fragmentation or checksum mismatches. resource utilization: track cpu, memory, and hardware health indicators like temperature and voltage. protocol health checks: monitor routing protocols (ospf, bgp) for stability and configuration anomalies. what are the critical router monitoring metrics? + critical metrics include: cpu and memory utilization: prevent performance degradation by tracking high resource use. network throughput: ensure traffic is handled efficiently across interfaces. latency and jitter: low latency is essential for real-time applications like voip. crc errors and collisions: high rates indicate faulty cables, interference, or hardware issues. power supply and temperature: overheating can cause unexpected device failures. tips for effective router monitoring in 2025 + to keep up with emerging technologies and evolving network demands: automate monitoring: use tools with automated discovery and anomaly detection features. leverage ai: employ machine learning to predict device failures or performance issues. integrate sd-wan monitoring: track application-level performance on software-defined wans. adopt zero-trust principles: incorporate continuous monitoring for security vulnerabilities.

backupdb.sh as root user for the central server and all probe servers. if opmanager is installed on a virtual machine , take a vm snapshot of the central and all probes. step 2: updating the central server start all probe services for smart update to take effect. go to the bin folder under opmanagercentral installation directory. windows os : run the updatemanager.bat file as administrator. linux os: run the updatemanager.sh file as root user. the update manager launcher appears on the screen. browse the required update pack file and click on install . follow the on-screen instructions to apply the update pack. once the update is complete, start the opmanagercentral service for the update to take effect. step 3: smart update (automatic updating of probe servers) the probe will automatically contact the central server. once the probe server detects a build number mismatch with the central server, all the probe services will be stopped. the probe server downloads the update pack from the central server and starts updating. once the update process is complete, restart all probe services. remember, if you are applying more than one update pack, you have to follow the instructions above for each update pack. for instance, if you are on build 124196 and have to move to 125203, here's how you should go about it: follow the steps (coressponding to your opmanager edition) to update to build 125010. ensure you start opmanager after this update. again stop opmanager and follow the update steps (coressponding to your opmanager edition) to move to build 125203.

problem in your switches affects most of your lan users. switch monitoring is essential to maintain your network in a healthy state. it is crucial to monitor the hardware as well as the traffic through the switch. network switch monitoring consists of switch port monitoring and mapping, switch performance monitoring, and switch traffic monitoring. there are separate tools available for each of these functions such as switch port monitoring software, switch traffic monitor, switch port mapper, etc. however, using multiple tools for monitoring switch becomes an annoying task for the it admins as the tools require: constant management additional resources for continuous monitoring substantial amount of time for learning it is always better to have a unified switch monitoring software or switch monitoring tool that can accomplish all these tasks. also, implementing a proactive network port monitoring system helps you detect problems early and avoid potential network pitfalls. manageengine opmanager: the ideal switch and network port monitoring solution manageengine opmanager is a comprehensive network switch or port monitoring software. with opmanager, you can monitor switch availability, health, and performance. opmanager's switch port monitoring functionality automatically discovers switches in your network and intuitively places them on a port view. using opmanager's switch monitoring capability, operators can gain visibility into the status and availability of switch ports. opmanager actively monitors switch ports and quickly notifies operators whenever a switch port or the switch goes down. operators can setup opmanager to monitor only critical ports, an industry best practice for switch monitoring, that prevents unnecessary alarms from being generated. opmanager also offers visibility into spanning tree status showing which ports are blocked and which ones are forwarding. you can also bundle opmanager with ncm and oputils to perform dedicated configuration management and port monitoring. port availability monitoring switch performance monitoring port-wise traffic monitoring switch interface monitoring alerting reporting port monitoring tools network port monitoring: monitors switch and switch ports availability with opmanager's network port monitor, you can create network maps in business views to graphically visualize your entire lan. opmanager can automatically send alerts when a link goes down. opmanager's reporting functionality also provides you with a detailed availability report of your switches and switch ports. you can use these reports to ensure that your slas are being met. network port monitoring: keep switch performance under control opmanager comes with several performance monitors to keep the switches performance in check. with switch performance monitoring, you can monitor critical switch performance metrics such as ip routing discards, cpu cost rate, total current buffer, jabber packets, undersize or oversize packets, drop events stats and more. along with vendor monitors and rmon monitors, you can also create custom monitors to scrutinize switch and their performance metrics with snmp support. network port monitoring: keep a track of port-wise traffic opmanager helps you monitor and troubleshoot network switch ports for traffic, utilization, errors and service level agreement (sla) verification. by presenting accurate information on port traffic and utilization, opmanager helps you identify top talkers on the lan. monitor network port utilization and traffic with threshold alerts. detect potential broadcast storms and proactively prevent the same. identify highly utilized and under-utilized ports. get alerted when a port starts discarding packets. network port monitoring: scrutinizes switch interfaces switches can have numerous interfaces, making switch monitoring difficult. opmanager comes with dedicated interface monitoring that discovers and monitors each and every interface present in the network switches. opmanager's interface monitor scrutinizes and features in and out speed of each interface. it also displays the availability status of interfaces along with the admin status and operational status so that you'll know whether the interface is up or down. network port monitoring: alerts on faulty switches leverage opmanager's proactive alerting mechanism to instantly identify faults on network switches. opmanager performs threshold based monitoring so when threshold level of a switch breaches, opmanager finds it as a faulty device and instantly notifies network admins. this alerting can be done through various notification profiles such as sms, email, slack, ticket logs and web alarms. you can also configure to automatically run a command or program, when a particluar fault arises, eliminating the need for network admins. for cases where a network admin is busy with critical tasks, or when an alarm goes unattended, you can configure to escalate those alarms to an alternate person. network port monitoring: active reporting on switch health and performance opmanager offers more than 100 intuitive reports on health and performance of its network devices. it collects and stores data of switches in the form of graphs that helps network admins easily understand critical metrics at different intervals of time. for instance, report on \"switch health\" displays graph on switch availability, packet loss, reponse time, backpane utilization and other performance metrics. you can also choose to export or schedule these reports as you require. network port monitoring: switch port monitoring tools real-time switch monitoring tools such as switch port mapper and stp tool are bundled with opmanager. switch port mapper the switch port mapper is a useful utility that is embedded in opmanager. it helps you to quickly find out the list of devices connected to the switch ports. stp tool spanning tree protocol details for each port can be viewed using the stp tool. this gives you valuable information about the spanning tree state of each port such as which ports are blocking and which ports are forwarding

uptime is the measure of availability of a server or any network component to its end users. the process of checking the availability of network devices at regular intervals is called uptime monitoring. uptime monitoring helps ensure all the components remain functional without experiencing downtime. how does uptime monitoring work? + uptime can be monitored by performing availability checks at regular intervals using internet message protocol (icmp) ping and telnet. uptime monitor sends pings to network components at continuous intervals. if the network component fails to respond over the two attempts, it is categorized as an unavailable device. discover more on uptime monitoring featured server uptime monitoring availability monitoring network latency monitoring quick links

vmware technology throughout the manageengine suite of network management software solutions. manageengine will support customers who run manageengine products on supported operating systems, irrespective of whether they are running in vmware environments or not. manageengine supports operating systems, not specific hardware configurations. vmware operates as a hardware abstraction layer. vmware supports a set of certified operating systems and hardware, and the customer and vmware will be responsible for any interactions or issues that arise at the hardware or operating system layer as a result of their use of vmware. manageengine will not require customers to recreate and troubleshoot every issue in a non-vmware environment; however, manageengine does reserve the right to request customers to diagnose certain issues in a native certified operating system environment, operating without the virtual environment. manageengine will only make this request when there is reason to believe that the virtual environment is a contributing factor to the issue. any time spent on investigation of problems that may, in the sole opinion of manageengine be related to vmware, will be handled in the following fashion: manageengine will provide standard support for all of its manageengine products. if a problem is encountered while manageengine products are running in a vmware environment, the customer may be required to recreate the problem on a non-vmware server unit, at which time manageengine will provide regular support. the customer can authorize manageengine to investigate the vmware related items at normal time and materials rates. if such investigation shows that the problem is vmware related, the customer may contract manageengine to provide a software change to resolve the issue if such a resolution is possible. regardless of the problem type or source, if the problem is determined to be a non vmware related issue - time spent on investigation and resolution will be covered as part of regular maintenance, and support will be provided as usual. please note: while manageengine solutions are expected to function properly in a vmware virtual environment, there may be performance implications which may require modification to our standard sizing recommendations. contacting manageengine support customers can call manageengine customer response center for logging and resolving any technical problems. this center is operational 24 hours and staffed by experienced product specialists. they are accessible at: +1 925 924 9500 and
